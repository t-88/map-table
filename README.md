# Map Table
this is my implementation of hash table, github told me to give a cool name so map table it is.    
i use macros to generate code for types that are not list like int , double , float...   


## Resources
-   all thx to this nice [doc](https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table/tree/master/07-appendix) 
## Limitation
-   cant be used with list types
-   u have to put in mind that its build with macros, there cons and pros to this.
